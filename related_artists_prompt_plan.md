# **Step-by-Step Blueprint for Building the Project**

### **1. Setup and Project Structure**
   - Choose the technology stack:
     - **Frontend:** React (for web), React Native (for mobile)
     - **Backend (optional):** Node.js/Express (if needed for API proxy)
   - Initialize the project using `create-react-app` or `expo init`
   - Configure environment variables for API credentials
   - Install dependencies (React Router, TailwindCSS, Axios, Spotify Web API SDK)

### **2. Implement Spotify OAuth Authentication**
   - Set up Spotify Developer App and obtain client credentials
   - Implement OAuth flow:
     - Redirect user to Spotify authorization URL
     - Handle OAuth callback and retrieve access token
     - Store access and refresh tokens securely
   - Implement token refresh logic

### **3. Implement Artist Search with Autocomplete**
   - Create a search input component
   - Fetch artist suggestions from Spotifyâ€™s Search API as user types
   - Display results in a dropdown
   - Allow user to select an artist

### **4. Fetch Related Artists and Their Top Tracks**
   - Retrieve related artists using Spotifyâ€™s Related Artists API
   - Fetch the top 10 tracks for each related artist
   - Aggregate and structure track data for playlist creation

### **5. Implement Playlist Creation**
   - Generate an auto-named playlist: `"Related Artists Top Tracks for [Input Artist]"`
   - Create the playlist in the userâ€™s Spotify account
   - Add retrieved tracks to the playlist

### **6. Implement UI and User Feedback**
   - Display loading states, success messages, and errors
   - Show playlist creation progress

### **7. Implement Error Handling & Edge Cases**
   - Handle authentication failures and expired tokens
   - Handle missing data (e.g., an artist has no related artists)
   - Implement retries for network failures

### **8. Testing & Refinement**
   - Unit tests for API calls and authentication
   - UI tests for search and playlist creation flow
   - Integration tests for full user journey

# **Breaking Down Into Iterative Chunks**

### **Phase 1: Project Setup**
1. Initialize the project (`create-react-app` or `expo init`)
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up environment variables for API credentials

### **Phase 2: Implement Authentication**
4. Implement Spotify OAuth login flow
5. Store and refresh access tokens
6. Display authenticated user info

### **Phase 3: Implement Artist Search**
7. Create search UI with input field
8. Implement autocomplete fetching from Spotify API
9. Allow user to select an artist

### **Phase 4: Fetch Related Artists & Top Tracks**
10. Fetch related artists for the selected artist
11. Retrieve top 10 tracks for each related artist
12. Store and display retrieved track data

### **Phase 5: Create Playlist**
13. Generate an auto-named playlist
14. Create a new playlist in the userâ€™s Spotify account
15. Add tracks to the playlist

### **Phase 6: UI & User Experience Enhancements**
16. Show progress/loading indicators
17. Display success/error messages

### **Phase 7: Testing & Deployment**
18. Write unit tests for API interactions
19. Conduct integration testing
20. Deploy to production

# **Refining Steps Into LLM Prompts**

Each prompt builds upon the previous steps in a test-driven approach.

---

### **Prompt 1: Project Initialization**
```text
Create a new React (or React Native) project. Install the following dependencies:
- React Router (if web)
- Axios (for API calls)
- Spotify Web API JS SDK
- TailwindCSS (for styling)

Ensure environment variables are set up for Spotify API credentials.
```

---

### **Prompt 2: Implement Spotify OAuth**
```text
Implement Spotify OAuth authentication in the project:
- Redirect users to the Spotify authorization URL
- Handle the OAuth callback and retrieve access token
- Securely store and refresh tokens as needed
- Display authenticated user info on the homepage
```

---

### **Prompt 3: Implement Artist Search with Autocomplete**
```text
Create a search input component that:
- Fetches artist suggestions from Spotifyâ€™s Search API
- Displays matching artist names in a dropdown
- Allows user to select an artist
- Uses debouncing to optimize API calls
```

---

### **Prompt 4: Fetch Related Artists & Top Tracks**
```text
Implement functions to:
- Retrieve related artists for a selected artist using Spotifyâ€™s Related Artists API
- Fetch the top 10 tracks for each related artist
- Store and structure the track data for playlist creation
```

---

### **Prompt 5: Implement Playlist Creation**
```text
Create a function that:
- Generates an auto-named playlist in the userâ€™s Spotify account
- Adds the retrieved tracks to the playlist
- Displays a success message upon completion
```

---

### **Prompt 6: UI Enhancements & User Feedback**
```text
Enhance the UI by:
- Showing loading indicators while fetching data
- Displaying success messages upon playlist creation
- Handling and displaying errors in a user-friendly way
```

---

### **Prompt 7: Testing & Error Handling**
```text
Write tests for:
- Spotify OAuth authentication flow
- API calls for artist search, related artists, and top tracks
- Playlist creation and track addition

Ensure robust error handling for:
- Authentication failures
- Missing related artists
- API rate limits and network errors
```
