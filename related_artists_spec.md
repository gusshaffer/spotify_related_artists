# Related Artists Top Tracks Playlist Generator

## Overview

This application is a mobile/web solution that allows users to generate a Spotify playlist containing the top 10 tracks from every artist in the "Related Artists" list for a chosen artist. The application connects to the user’s Spotify account via OAuth, uses Spotify’s APIs for artist search (with autocomplete), retrieves related artists, and then automatically creates a single, auto-named playlist populated with the top tracks.

## User Journey

1. **Authentication:**
   - The user launches the app and is prompted to log in with Spotify via OAuth.
   - On the first login, the application obtains and securely stores the necessary access (and refresh) tokens for future interactions.

2. **Artist Search:**
   - The user is presented with a search bar featuring autocomplete and suggestions powered by Spotify’s API.
   - As the user types, matching artist names are displayed.

3. **Artist Selection & Data Retrieval:**
   - The user selects an artist from the search suggestions.
   - The app uses Spotify’s API to fetch the “Related Artists” for the selected artist.
   - For each related artist, the application retrieves the top 10 tracks using Spotify’s top tracks endpoint.

4. **Playlist Creation:**
   - The application auto-generates a playlist name, e.g., “Related Artists Top Tracks for [Input Artist].”
   - A single playlist is created in the user’s Spotify account.
   - The retrieved top tracks (10 per related artist) are added to the playlist automatically.

## Functional Requirements

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Implement Spotify’s OAuth authentication flow.
  - Securely store access and refresh tokens for future requests.
  - Handle token expiration and refresh automatically.

- **Artist Search & Autocomplete:**
  - Provide a search interface with real-time suggestions using Spotify’s Search API (search type: artist).
  - Display artist details (e.g., name, thumbnail) in search suggestions.

- **Data Retrieval:**
  - Fetch the “Related Artists” for the selected artist using the Spotify Related Artists endpoint.
  - For each related artist, use the Top Tracks endpoint to retrieve 10 tracks. (Optionally, specify a market parameter, e.g., “US”, to standardize results.)

- **Playlist Creation:**
  - Automatically generate a playlist name in the format: “Related Artists Top Tracks for [Input Artist]”.
  - Create a new playlist in the authenticated user’s Spotify account.
  - Populate the playlist with the aggregated tracks (order can be defined as needed).

- **User Interface:**
  - Responsive design suitable for both mobile and web platforms.
  - Clear feedback to the user during each step (e.g., loading states, success messages, and error notifications).

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**
  - Secure storage of OAuth tokens using best practices (e.g., secure cookies, encrypted storage on mobile).
  - Ensure all communications with Spotify’s API use HTTPS.
  
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize API calls to reduce latency (consider parallel requests for fetching top tracks for related artists).
  - Use caching strategies where appropriate (e.g., caching search suggestions during a session).

- **Scalability & Maintainability:**
  - Write modular code to separate concerns (authentication, API integration, UI components).
  - Consider using a modern frontend framework (such as React or Vue) for web and React Native or Flutter for mobile.

## Architecture Choices

- **Frontend:**
  - **Web:** Use a framework like React for a responsive single-page application.
  - **Mobile:** Consider React Native or Flutter to share code with the web version or build separately if preferred.

- **Backend / API Integration:**
  - Depending on complexity, either:
    - Use a client-only architecture where API calls are made directly from the frontend (if CORS and token security can be managed properly).
    - Or implement a lightweight backend (e.g., Node.js/Express) to manage API requests, token refresh logic, and secure storage of sensitive data.
  - **Spotify API Endpoints:**
    - **OAuth Authentication:** Redirect to Spotify’s authorization URL and handle callback.
    - **Search API:** `GET /v1/search?type=artist&q=[artist_name]`
    - **Related Artists:** `GET /v1/artists/{artist_id}/related-artists`
    - **Top Tracks:** `GET /v1/artists/{artist_id}/top-tracks?market=US`
    - **Create Playlist:** `POST /v1/users/{user_id}/playlists`
    - **Add Tracks to Playlist:** `POST /v1/playlists/{playlist_id}/tracks`

- **Data Handling:**
  - Only temporary storage of tokens and session data is required.
  - No long-term storage of user data is necessary beyond what’s needed for authentication.
  - Data retrieved from Spotify is used immediately for playlist creation and not stored persistently.

## Error Handling Strategies

- **Authentication Errors:**
  - If token retrieval or refresh fails, redirect the user to re-authenticate.
  - Provide clear error messaging if the OAuth flow encounters issues.

- **API Errors:**
  - Handle network errors, rate limiting, or invalid responses from Spotify with retry logic and user notifications.
  - Validate API responses before processing. For example, if the related artists list is empty, inform the user.

- **User Input Errors:**
  - Validate the artist input in the search bar.
  - Handle cases where no matching artist is found with a friendly message.

- **Playlist Creation Errors:**
  - Ensure that if any error occurs during playlist creation or track addition, the user is notified, and the app logs details for troubleshooting.

## Testing Plan

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Test individual modules (authentication, search, data retrieval, playlist creation).
  - Mock Spotify API responses to simulate different scenarios (success, error, empty responses).

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Validate the end-to-end flow from authentication to playlist creation.
  - Ensure that OAuth tokens are refreshed correctly and that API calls return expected data.

- **User Interface Testing:**
  - Perform usability testing for the search interface and autocomplete functionality.
  - Test responsiveness on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

- **Error Handling Testing:**
  - Simulate API failures, network errors, and invalid user inputs to ensure robust error handling.
  - Test scenarios where Spotify API rate limiting is encountered.

- **Security Testing:**
  - Ensure secure handling and storage of OAuth tokens.
  - Verify that sensitive API calls are made over HTTPS and that no sensitive data is exposed.

## Additional Considerations

- **Logging & Monitoring:**
  - Implement logging for key operations (authentication, API requests, playlist creation).
  - Use monitoring tools to capture and alert on errors in production.

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Optionally, add a review step for users to select which related artists’ tracks to include.
  - Expand market support by allowing users to choose their preferred market for top tracks.
  - Provide options for users to reorder or customize the generated playlist after creation.

This specification should provide a clear roadmap for developers to implement the application with all necessary details for authentication, data retrieval, playlist creation, error handling, and testing.
